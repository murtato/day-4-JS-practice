       /* EXERCISE 2 */
       /* Give the hippo object some abilities, hint: 'use the dot':

          1) Give the hippo a name
          2) Give the hippo a weight
          3) Give the hippo a function that makes it dance( have the function just print
             "I'm Dancin" to the console )
          4) A hippo is a dangerous animal, prove that's the case by giving it an attack
             function. When this attack function is called it will print to the console the
             value of it's weight property concatenated with the string:  "'s tons of beast
             coming at you."

       /* You have decided to keep your hippo on a strict diet, so it won't gain or lose any
          weight, and to do this you want to prevent the weight property from being writable,
          so change that property on your hippo object so no changes to the weight can take place.
       */

       /* EXERCISE 4 */
       /* One of your hippo's cousin is in town, and they happen to be one of the movie star hippos
          featured in National Geographic's documentary 'Cocaine Hippos',which chronicled the lives of
          the descendants of the original four hippos brought to South America as pets for Pablo Escobar.
          Needless to say this 'star' hippo has arrived with an Entourage of hippos to visit your hippo on
          the nile. Your hippo is having trouble keeping track of all the requests these hollywood types are making
          and needs some way of grouping together a collection of items into one container.
          The items are strings representing their requests: "No brown m&m's" , "1200 grass count resting mats",
          "Scented submerging pools" , "A plethora of rolling marbles to maniacally chomp after whenever the
          hunger strikes". Add a container to your hippo that has all these strings inside of it.
       */

       /* EXERCISE 5 */
       /* Your hippo is a bit worried that these visitors will keep piling up requests or other tasks and so
          has asked you to prevent anything else from being piled on. So you will have to prevent anything else
          being added to your hippos plate. */

       /* EXERCISE 6 */
       /* On the nile, where your hippo lives, occasionally the game warden has to come by and inspect all the
          hippos to make sure everything is in order.  The game warden has a function that inspects that a hippo
          has its own name and weight property assigned to it, if it does it return true.  This will ensure that the
          hippo had these properties assigned when it was born/created, and not inherited.
          The warden also has a function that will list out all of the names and values of the properties that your
          hippo has. */

       /* EXERCISE 7 */
       /* The warden also has a function that will examine the properties of the hippo and if it detects that there is
          property that looks like a collection of values inside one structure, it will loop through that collection
          and print out to the console the items in the collection.
       */

       /* EXERCISE 8 */
       /* Your hippo could barely even collect the Entourage's requests, let alone service them, so you need to provide
          a host object that can help with the guests.

          We want to add a function to the host object called 'examineRequest'.
          This function will have your hippo as a parameter passed in. The function will take a look at your hippo and see
          if there is something that looks like it has a list of requests, it will check the type of the item in the collection,
          and if it is a string it will see if anywhere in that string the word 'm&m' can be found. It will ignore this request
          but for all the others it will print the concatenation of "Getting" and the string it finds in the collection.
       */

       /* EXERCISE 9 */
       /* You want to be very careful though that these demanding guests have no opportunity to take advantage of
          the host. In order to do this you must ensure that there is no way the guests can add any demands or
          other properties to the host, you must lock down everything!.
        */

       /* EXERCISE 10 */
       /* One of the guest hippos has been eating quite a lot and your animal feeders have been continually called to
          the guest quarters to provide food. You want to be able to have the feeder just keep feeding the hippo until
          it is full, rather than having to keep coming back the the guests room. Here's what we would like to do:

          Create a feeder object that has a function called feed which takes a hippo object as a parameter.
          Design a guest object that has a function called eat and a property called full, where full can be either
          true or false, and a property called eatCount, which will be a number. Each time the eat function is called on the
          guest object, it will increment the eatCount, checking to see if its 10, and when eatCount gets to 10, it will set
          full to true.

          Make sure that passing the guest hippo to the feed function of our feeder object, and calling that function just
          once will ensure that our guest hippo is fed until full.

          What you're being asked to do is write a recursive function, a function that calls itself.
