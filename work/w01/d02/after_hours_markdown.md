## Make Cheatsheets for HTML, CSS, and Command Line

Markdown is a simplified way of getting information onto a page without any design thrills.

It's clean. It's obvious. And it saves you OODLES of time in documenting your code.

### After Hours

**Create cheatsheets for:**

1. Bash (the Command Line)
2. HTML
3. CSS

Save your cheatsheet in your `WDI_DTLA_8/resources/cheatsheets/` directory, and name them `bash_cheatsheet.md`, for example.

This will test your ability to read documentation, while teaching you how to use Markdown. 

Remember, this is a *cheatsheet*, not an exhaustive reference. Include only the tags, properties, and/or commands you feel you'll use often. [Here's an example.](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_DTLA_8/blob/master/resources/cheatsheets/mac_gui_cheatsheet.md)
